		<p>Gephi is an open-source network analysis and visualization software that allows users to explore, analyze, and visualize complex network data. It is widely used by researchers, data scientists, and analysts to gain insights into social networks, biological networks, and other types of complex systems. Gephi provides a range of tools and features for network analysis, including the ability to import data from various sources, analyze network structure, and apply different layouts and algorithms to visualize the network. It also supports a range of graph formats, including directed and undirected graphs, and can handle large datasets with ease.

			To demonstrate the purpose of Gephi, a visualisation could be created using real-world data, such as social media interactions or website traffic. The visualisation could show the relationships between different nodes in the network, such as users or web pages, and highlight patterns and trends in the data</p>


		<h3>Nodes after calculation of Between Centrality</h3>
		<img src="Gephi/Betweened Centrality.svg" alt=""  class="gep">

		<p class="desc">Betweenness centrality is a fundamental measure of network centrality in network analysis, and it is one of the many centralities that can be computed in Gephi. Betweenness centrality measures the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes in the network. This measure is particularly useful for identifying the most important or influential nodes in the network, as nodes with high betweenness centrality are often critical to maintaining connectivity and facilitating communication between other nodes.

			In Gephi, betweenness centrality can be computed using various algorithms, including Brandes' algorithm and Newman's algorithm, and the results can be visualized using different layouts and node coloring schemes. Users can also use the betweenness centrality measure to filter or rank nodes based on their importance in the network, making it easier to identify key players or influential groups. </p>

		<h3>MODULARITY PARTITIONING</h3>
		<img src="Gephi/Modularity partition.svg" alt="" class="gep">
		<p class="desc">In Gephi, the modularity partitioning function can be used to identify and visualize communities in a network based on their modularity score. The function uses a range of algorithms, including the Louvain method, to optimize the modularity score and partition the network into distinct communities. Users can also adjust the resolution parameter to control the granularity of the community detection and refine the results.</p>


		<h3>GeoLayout Application</h3>
		<img src="Gephi/GeoLayout and Noverlap.svg" alt="" class="gep">
		<p class="desc">Geolayout is a layout algorithm available in Gephi that is specifically designed for visualizing geographic networks. This algorithm maps nodes in the network to geographic locations based on latitude and longitude coordinates, allowing users to create interactive and dynamic maps that display the spatial relationships between nodes.</p>

		

		<h3>Gephi Final Result</h3>
		<img src="Gephi/final map.png" alt="" class="gep">
		<p class="desc">The final result depict the nodes placed on the Map for which the points were being separated and classified. Overall, Overall, the geolayout function is a powerful tool for creating dynamic and interactive geographic network visualizations, and it can be a valuable addition to any network analysis toolkit.</p>

		<p>A choropleth map is a type of map that uses color to represent different values of a given variable across a geographic area. In D3.js, a popular JavaScript library for data visualization, choropleth maps can be created using geoJSON data and SVG elements.</p>


		<p class="italy">(Hover over the countries to see their status)</p>
        <svg  width="1000" height="700" class="d3jsimg"></svg>
    <script src="bundle.js"></script>

		<p class="desc">A choropleth map can be a powerful tool for visualizing and comparing data across geographic regions. In the above visualisation, a choropleth map can be used to show the level of economic development across different countries or regions of the world. In this type of map, countries or regions are grouped into categories such as developed, developing, and underdeveloped based on a set of criteria. Each category is assigned a different color on the map, allowing viewers to easily see the distribution of economic development across the world. The map can also be interactive, allowing users to zoom in on specific regions or hover over countries to see more detailed information.</p>

		<p class="desc">Global GDP and CO2 emissions are two interconnected aspects of the global economy that have significant effects and consequences on the environment. The growth of global GDP has been a driving force behind the increase in carbon emissions, which in turn have had severe consequences for the environment, including global warming, climate change, and environmental degradation. This essay will explore the correlation between global GDP and CO2 emissions, the effects and consequences of high CO2 emissions, and the measures that can be taken to mitigate these effects.

			The correlation between global GDP and CO2 emissions is clear. As countries become more industrialized and their economies grow, the demand for energy increases, leading to an increase in carbon emissions. According to the World Bank, the global GDP has increased from $42.2 trillion in 1990 to $87.7 trillion in 2019. This significant increase in the global GDP has led to an increase in carbon emissions, which have risen from 22.9 billion metric tons in 1990 to 36.4 billion metric tons in 2019.</p>
